# TwitterTimeline
Simple Twitter timeline app, which works very simmilarly as official Twitter.app timelines


It does almost all that you see in Twitter timelines.

  * Remembers where you left the timeline and loads tweets since that 'id + 30' next time you open app.
  * Loads images using AFNetworking, so it don't lags.
  * Plays Video/Gifs.
  * You can Fav/RT.

It all needs a lot work to actually use it, but this repo gives idea about my way how it's can be done.
I actually wanted to make full Twitter app, but a lot of necessary APIs isn't public in Twitter REST API, like replies.json to certain tweet.
